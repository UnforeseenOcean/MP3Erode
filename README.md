# MP3Erode
Generation loss experiment for MP3

## Usage
1. Place any WAV or MP3 file (with this specific syntax: file(number).wav) to the folder with the script and FFMPEG executable.
Note: If you use MP3, it will show error first, but don't worry, it will pick the file up from the next wave and carry on.
2. Run the script.
3. Set the offset, it must be a number.
4. Set when to stop (nth conversion)
5. Feel the insanity.

## Note
The outcome really depends on the encoder, so try changing it to different encoders to see what changes.
