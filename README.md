# MP3Erode
Generation loss experiment for MP3

## Usage
Just rename the MP3 file to 0.mp3 and unzip ffmpeg.exe and the script to the same folder.

Make sure all the files are in the same folder.

Then just run the script. It'll do the job for you.

## Note
By default, this uses ACM codec instead of LAME. The outcome really depends on the encoder, so try changing it too.
