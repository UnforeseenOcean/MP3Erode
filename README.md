# MP3Erode
Generation loss experiment for MP3

## Usage
1. Place any WAV file (with number-only filename) to the folder with the script and FFMPEG executable.
2. Run the script.
3. Set the offset, it must be a number.
4. Set when to stop (nth conversion)
5. Feel the insanity.

## Note
The outcome really depends on the encoder, so try changing it to different encoders to see what changes.
